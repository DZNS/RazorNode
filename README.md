RazorNode is a NodeJS SDK for [RazorPay][1]. It focuses on being simple, extensible and thoroughly tested. It internally uses Promises to allow for a robust asynchornous code that doesn't üç≤ up. 

### Install all the Razors

To install, simply run  
````bash
npm install razornode
````

To start using RazorNode, simply create a new instance and get started:
````javascript
var razorNode = require("razornode");
var instance  = new razorNode(process.env.rzKey, process.env.rzSecret);

instance.getPayments("2015-09-01", "2015-09-30")
.then(function (result) {
    //result has two keys
    //result.response has the response body 
    //result.responseObject has the parsed JSON
})

````  
As you can see, we're pulling in the key and secret of your RazorPay account from the environment variables. You're free to set things up as per your preference, but this seems to be the recommended way (by some Javascript Dude, so don't quote me on it üòâ)

Want to test it? 
*Please read the header of the test file located at `./test/test.js` before running the tests.*

If you don't have Mocha installed
````bash
npm install -g mocha
````

Then simply run
````bash
npm run test-local
````

### Author's Notes
- RazorNode is written in ES6. It's currently transpiled into ES5 for supporting `0.12.x`. At some point, I'll remove the transpiled files from the repo and change things to use the ES6 files. However, if you'd like to keep using transpiled versions, simply install the `babel-cli` and run `npm run build`.
- RazorNode is a 3rd party implementation. I'm a RazorPay customer. I do not work for or at RazorPay and I'm in no way affiliated with them.
